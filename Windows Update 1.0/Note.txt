You can execute any source from the sources of this file except tools.exe
Whatever you do, Don't touch tools.exe(unless you want to)

tools.exe can overwrite winver.exe so if you accidentally ran the program
on your main pc, don't complain that your windows changed, tools.exe will
change your windows version from your windows version to Windows 666
